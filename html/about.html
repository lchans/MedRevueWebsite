        A ‘revue’ is light, theatrical entertainment consisting of short sketches, 
        songs and dances. If you’ve ever seen Monty Python in their olden days, it’s 
        like that plus live bands, singing, dancing as well and some pretty pro 
        video clips among other awesome theatre stuff.

        Med Revue is an all singing, all dancing, skits and clips, comedy stage show!
        It’s about providing a performance and theatre craft avenue for anyone 
        and everyone, regardless of degree or ability.<br>

        It’s about getting on a stage and making people laugh, building that 
        stage set with your own hands, belting out a number and making them 
        applaud, programming strobes and smoke machines, sewing up a mad costume, 
        cooking up a storm or convincing 2000 people to come see your show.<br>

        It’s about meeting new people, making friends for uni and life, 
        performing hard and partying hard. It’s about being part of a hallmark 
        event in UNSW’s calendar and being a part of one of the largest 
        communities on campus.

                       (As written by the producer of the first UNSW Med Revue, Dr. Greg Deacon)
        In May 1974 three 3rd year medical students from the University of NSW, 
        Jonathan Marks, Eric Wegman and Greg Deacon attended the Sydney University 
        Medical Revue and were inspired to organise a similar revue at UNSW. 
        There had never been any type of revue at UNSW. Over the ensuing 12 months 
        they made it happen.<br><br>

        The Medical Faculty was very supportive particularly the Professor of 
        Pathology, Don Wilhelm. One of the first tasks was selecting a venue. 
        The Physics Theatrette was chosen. This was a theatre in the Physics 
        building that seated about 330. It had a small stage and reasonable back 
        stage facilities. The second Med Revue was held in the Science Theatre 
        however this was three times the size with much poorer back stage 
        facilities. It had nowhere to store the large number of huge props which 
        we made and was not available for rehearsals until 2 or 3 days before 
        the performances commenced. In contrast the Physics Theatrette was always 
        available. Subsequent revues of all types for many years were held in 
        the Physics Theatrette which was refurbished in the early 1980s. I don’t 
        believe the Physics Theatrette any longer exists. One of the key factors i
        n the success of the first two revues was the recruiting of Andrew Field 
        to the team. He was a great organizer and was both the co-producer with 
        Greg Deacon and co-director with Bob Wells.<br><br>

        The other key people were Greg Bellamy the musical director and pianist 
        along with guitarist Paul Holz, major scriptwriter George Faithful, 
        performers Russell Knudsen, John Moran, Greg Downey, Greg Reading and 
        Warren Stowe and costume makers Annette Trotter and Anne Donnelley.<br><br>

        Everything had to be done for the first time, there was no money so the 
        key organisers lent the funds. There was no experience from anyone as 
        this was the first ever revue at the university. We designed and produced 
        programmes, tickets, T shirts, props, costumes and posters, doing most 
        of the work at our parents’ homes. We hand printed the posters, silk 
        screened the T shirts and typeset the programme gluing on the text 
        and the photos.<br><br>
         The name chosen for the first Med Revue was Rumpleforeskin. It was a 
        brilliant title that made publicising the show very easy. The first 
        poster was a smiling phallus that would be described in today’s 
        vernacular as going viral. It was picked up by a raunchy Kings Cross 
        magazine called “Ribald”. Before long the Med Faculty told us we could 
        keep the name but we had to produce a less suggestive poster! One of our 
        fathers designed a more acceptable logo and we covered both UNSW and 
        Sydney University with posters.<br><br>

        Our concerns about ticket sales soon disappeared as the tickets sold 
        very rapidly. We managed all the ticket sales ourselves, plus organised 
        the front of house. The Revue ran Thursday to Sunday in the first week 
        of May 1975. As it drew closer to the opening we realised we needed 
        artistic assistance to prevent a disaster. Andrew Field invited Bob Wells, 
        a semi professional singer and dancer to assist us in the last two weeks. 
        He was the only non medical student involved and was an enormous help as 
        choreographer and co-director. After the last night the cast and crew 
        partied until dawn at Greg Deacon’s parents’ home with the band playing 
        all night. There were no noise restrictions in 1975.<br><br>
                We still have an audio recording of the first revue and many photographs 
        but no video. Video recording was primitive and expensive. A black and 
        white video recording was made however unfortunately has been lost. We 
        finished with a surplus allowing us to donate $1000 to the Cystic Fibrosis 
        Society plus had some seed funds for the next year’s show.<br><br>
        
        The second Med Revue held in 1976 was called “Pandemonia (or Thanks for 
        the Mammary)”. Many of us regretted not simply calling it Rumpleforeskin 
        2. It had the same key cast and crew, now in 5th year, however was far 
        bigger in every way. Far larger cast, more lavish costumes and props 
        plus we made a 30 minute film and held it in the Science Theatre.<br><br>

        The film was written and directed by Eric Wegman. A keen member of the 
        university film society, Michael Gillett, was recommended to us as a 
        camera man. He agreed to do the job for free so long as we paid for the 
        film. He was the only other non medical student involved along with Bob 
        Wells. Bob participated from the first rehearsals in the 2nd revue.<br><br>

        The film was titled “Florence of Arabia” and starred Russell Knudsen as
        Rudolf Vaselino and Annette Hamori as Florence. It was silent, except for 
        the introduction, made on 16mm film with sub titles, background music and 
        sound effects. It was introduced kindly by the film expert Bill Collins 
        and produced and edited by Jonathan Marks, Steve Lynch and Greg Deacon.<br><br>

        The revue was held on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the first week of 
        May 1976. It was again a sell out with yet another party until dawn at 
        the Deacons. The total expenses were $8,000, a huge sum for 1976, 
        however with income of $10,000 there was a surplus of $2000 for the 
        Cystic Fibrosis Society. The film and 2nd UNSW Med Revue are preserved on DVD.<br><br>
